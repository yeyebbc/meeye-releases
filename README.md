# Meeye Icon Pack Releases

## Methods of Downloading

### GitHub Releases

Use [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/yeyebbc/meeye-releases/releases) to manually download APKs.

**Optional**

Use [Obtainium](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/dev.imranr.obtainium.fdroid/) to notify you when a new Meeye is released. However a first time set-up is required.

### Within Telegram Group

If you have joined Meeye’s only official Telegram group, search for #updates or #更新 to get both Meeye and Meeyo releases.

### OneDrive Shared Link

If you prefer this way, [here is the link](https://1drv.ms/f/c/dc6bae0a0009378c/Eow3CQAKrmsggNwn6gQAAAABQhLORX2toS1y1cUXGKodJw?e=Czcdsq). I will keep them available as long as I am still subscribing Office 365 (which now called Microsoft Copilot 365).
